Internship Project: SMS Classifier and Cat-Dog Image Classifier

During my internship at Bharat Intern company, I was tasked with completing two projects that involved developing machine learning models using Python. This repository contains the code and results for both projects.

Project 1: SMS Classifier

The goal of this project was to develop a text classification model to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam using data science techniques in Python. I used the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from Kaggle[ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset ], which contains 5572 SMS messages labeled as either spam or ham.

I implemented a logistic regression model using scikit-learn, with a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert the text data into numerical features. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.5% on the test set.

Project 2: Cat-Dog Image Classifier

The goal of this project was to develop an image classification model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs using data science techniques in Python. I used the Dogs vs. Cats Redux: Kernels Edition dataset from Kaggle [ https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data ], which contains 25,000 images of cats and dogs.

I implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras, with a pre-trained VGG16 model as the base model. The model achieved an accuracy of 90.2% on the test set.

What I Learned

During this internship, I gained hands-on experience with various machine learning techniques and tools, including:

> Text classification using logistic regression and TF-IDF vectorization
> Image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning
> Data preprocessing and feature engineering
> Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
> Working with popular machine learning libraries and frameworks, including scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras
I also learned how to work with large datasets, handle imbalanced datasets, and optimize model performance.

Code
The code for both projects is included in this repository. You can run the code using Google Colab or a local Python environment.

Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Bharat Intern company for providing me with this opportunity to work on these projects and gain valuable experience in machine learning.
